 * branch_ops.h
 *	  Branch operations: making, deleting, checking out and listing a
 *	  database's branches.
 *
 * A branch has its own copy of every versioned object (one in a versioned
 * schema).  How the copies are made and kept is the implementation's
 * business: the one in branch_copies.c copies the source branch's catalog
 * rows and shares its relations' pages until either branch changes them.
 *
 * Contract:
 * - create and delete are transactional with the calling transaction: an
 *   aborted creation leaves no branch, an aborted deletion the branch.
 * - checkout changes the session's branch at once, and lasts until the
 *   next checkout or the end of the session.
 * - main can't be deleted, nor a branch any session is on.
